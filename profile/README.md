# The Loosely Organized Research Facility

**`CLASSIFICATION: OPEN SOURCE`** · **`STATUS: OPERATIONAL`**

Investigating at the edge of agentic communication — A2A, MCP, agent coordination, and the infrastructure that makes multi-agent systems actually work.

**LORF** is a small, independent research initiative studying how AI agents coordinate, communicate, and collaborate. We sit at the intersection of distributed systems, AI tooling, and developer experience.

We believe multi-agent systems are the next major paradigm shift in software development — and the coordination layer is the missing piece.

## Research Areas

```
AREA                      STATUS          CLASSIFICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
Agent Coordination        active          open
Institutional Memory      active          open
Agentic Protocols         researching     open
Agent-Native Tooling      researching     open
```

- **Agent Coordination** — Distributed locking, file claims, conflict resolution for multi-agent engineering teams
- **Institutional Memory** — Persistent knowledge bases that give AI agents continuity across sessions
- **Agentic Protocols** — A2A, MCP, and emerging standards for agent-to-agent communication
- **Agent-Native Tooling** — Interfaces and developer tools designed for AI-first workflows

## Flagship Project

[**Nexus**](https://github.com/mhofwell/nexus-2) — Open-source coordination infrastructure for multi-agent systems. Because coordination should be a shared resource, not a proprietary advantage.

## Design Philosophy

Dashed borders. Monospace everything. Minimal palette. The aesthetic of a research facility that cares more about the work than the polish — but still has good taste.

 |  "Loosely Organized" — a nod to both the loosely coupled systems we       |
 |  study and the informal, experimental nature of the work.                 |

Open source. Research should be shared.
