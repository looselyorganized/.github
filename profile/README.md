### STATUS: Operational

We build coordination infrastructure for multi-agent systems. Distributed locking, institutional memory, agentic protocols — the plumbing that makes AI agents work together without stepping on each other.

Everything here is open source. If agents are going to run the world, the coordination layer shouldn't be proprietary.

## Research Areas

- **Agent Coordination** — Distributed locking, file claims, conflict resolution for multi-agent engineering teams
- **Institutional Memory** — Persistent knowledge bases that give AI agents continuity across sessions
- **Agentic Protocols** — A2A, MCP, and emerging standards for agent-to-agent communication
- **Agent-Native Tooling** — Interfaces and developer tools designed for AI-first workflows
